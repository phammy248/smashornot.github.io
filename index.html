I truly apologize for launching the site that the Miami community found insulting. I never meant to start a site that would offend anyone, as this was never the goal of creating the website. I created the website because I was interested in the algorithms and programming part of it. I guess I needed more time to understand if the site was relevant for the Miamioh community or not. 

So coming back to you, if you felt hurt or offended in any way or form, I once again would like to apologize for the inconvenience.
